This is a [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-native-app`](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## This repo is a baseline build set up with the following tools
- Typescript
- Rematch (Redux simplified State Management)
- TailwindUI (for the CSS Styling)

## Utilize creditor to create new Comps, Models, and Pages
- An automated tool to manage the program structure and directory import aggregation
